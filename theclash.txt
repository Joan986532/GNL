The Clash - Career Opportunities

They offered me the office, offered me the shop
They said I'd better take anything they got
Do you wanna make tea at the BBC?
Do you wanna be, do you really wanna be a cop?
Career opportunities the one that never knock
Every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock
Career opportunities the one that never knock
I hate the army and I hate the R.A.F
I don't wanna go fighting in a tropical heat
I hate the civil service rules
I won't open letter bombs for you
Career opportunities, the one that never knock
Every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock
Career opportunities, the one that never knock
